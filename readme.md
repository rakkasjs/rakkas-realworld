> ### Rakkas codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc.) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://realworld.rakkasjs.org/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Rakkas](https://rakkasjs.org)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

**Rakkas** is a new framework without established style guides & best practices as of yet. This project is one of the first step towards establishing them.

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

## Deployments

The same app is deployed on:

- [Node](https://realworld.rakkasjs.org)
- [Vercel](https://rakkas-realworld.vercel.app/)
- [Netlify](https://rakkas-realworld.netlify.app/)
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://rakkas-realworld.rakkasjs.workers.dev/)

Serverless versions use the Node server as authentication backend because: a) it's hard or impossible to use `bcrypt` on serverless environments, and b) there is little CPU time available for secure hashing.

## Getting started
After cloning the repo, install the dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Rakkas RealWorld requires some environment variables to be set for configuration:

| Variable        | Description                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HOST`          | Host name or address (defaults to `localhost`)                                   |
| `PORT`          | Port number (defaults to `3000`)                                                 |
| `DATABASE_URL`  | Database URL (`postgresql://user:password@host/database`)                        | _ |
| `SERVER_SECRET` | A random string used to sign the JWT                                             |
| `SALT_ROUNDS`   | Bcrypt cost factor for hashing the passwords before storing them to the database |

If you intend to deploy on Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Workers, you should also set the `AUTH_API` variable and point it to a Node deployment.

For production, if your server is going to run behind a reverse proxy (as it should!), you must also add `TRUST_FORWARDED_ORIGIN=1` and configure your reverse proxy to set the headers `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Server`, `X-Forwarded-For` appropriately.

Once the environment variables are set, you should then generate the Prisma client with	`pnpx prisma generate`. Then you can start a dev server with `pnpm dev`.

When you're happy with the results, you can build and run a production server with these commands:

```sh
pnpm build # Build the app
pnpm start     # Start production server
```

## How it works

### Backend

#### REST API
The `src/api/_rest` directory contains an implementation of the [Conduit API spec](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api) as a set of Rakkas API routes and middleware functions. The backend uses [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for request body validation and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) for database access. The current implementation uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) for ease of deployment but [porting](#porting-to-other-database-systems) to another database system supported by Prisma (like MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL) is just a matter of changing a few lines.

#### Form API
The `src/api/form` directory contains an additional set of endpoints intended to respond to HTML form submissions. They allow **Rakkas RealWorld** to run even with JavaScript disabled, which is a good test for Rakkas's SSR abilities.

Every mutation operation in the REST API has a counterpart in the form API (all REST endpoints are to be prefixed with `/api/` and all form endpoints with `/api/form/`):

| Operation               | Rest method | Rest endpoint                         | Form endpoint (always `POST`)               |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Register                | `POST`      | `users`                               | `register`                                  |
| Login                   | `POST`      | `users/login`                         | `login`                                     |
| Logout                  | (N/A)ยน      | (N/A)ยน                                | `logout`                                    |
| Update profile settings | `PUT`       | `user`                                | `settings`                                  |
| Create article          | `POST`      | `article`                             | `article`                                   |
| Update article          | `PUT`       | `article/[slug]`                      | `article/[slug]`                            |
| Delete article          | `DELETE`    | `article/[slug]`                      | `article/[slug]/delete`                     |
| Create comment          | `POST`      | `article/[slug]/comments`             | `article/[slug]/comment`                    |
| Delete comment          | `DELETE`    | `article/[slug]/comments/[commentId]` | `article/[slug]/delete-comment-[commentId]` |
| Favorite article        | `POST`      | `article/[slug]/favorite`             | `article/[slug]/favorite`                   |
| Unfavorite article      | `DELETE`    | `article/[slug]/favorite`             | `article/[slug]/unfavorite`                 |
| Follow user             | `POST`      | `profile/[username]/follow`           | `profile/[username]/follow`                 |
| Unfollow user           | `DELETE`    | `profile/[username]/follow`           | `profile/[username]/unfollow`               |

ยน Logging out is carried out on the frontend by simply deleting the authentication cookie.

#### Test API
The `src/api/test` folder contains a few endpoints intended to be used as testing helpers. `/api/test/ping` responds to `HEAD` requests in order to detect the time the server becomes functional before starting the tests. A `POST` request to `/api/test/reset` resets the database, it is called before starting an integration test. A `POST` request to `/api/test/populate` seeds the database with some test data. A middleware protects these endpoints and only allows them to run when `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `test`.

### Frontend
The `src/pages` folder contains an implementation of [Conduit Routing guidelines](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/spec#routing-guidelines) in the form of a set of Rakkas pages and layouts. There are a few components to avoid repetition and an API client library (in `src/lib/conduit-client.ts`) to facilitate API communication and error handling. Other than that it is a fairly straightforward port of the [original HTML templates](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit/blob/master/FRONTEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md#layout).

One small thing that you may find strange is the use of uncontrolled form elements. Since client-side validation is not in the specification, it is actually the easiest way to implement form functionality.

## Development

### Testing
There are three types of tests in **Rakkas RealWorld**:

| Command           | Description      |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| npm run test:unit | Unit tests       |
| npm run test:api  | API tests        |
| npm run test:e2e  | End-to-end tests |

Before running the API or end-to-end tests, you have to start a development or production server on `localhost:3000` with `NODE_ENV` environment variable set to `test`.

`pnpm test` builds and starts a server and runs all three types of tests back to back. If you're using a `.env` file, you should set it's HOST and PORT to `localhost:3000` before running the tests this way.

Since most of the **Rakkas RealWorld** core consists of either dumb view code copied and pasted from the templates or straightforward calls to some library like `zod` or `prisma`, there are few **unit tests** at the moment. They are located next to the source modules they test.

**API tests** run by sending API requests to a running server and examining the responses. They are quite extensive and test almost every case. They are located in the `api-test` directory.

**End-to-end tests** use `cypress` and they test the common interaction scenarios. They are located in the `cypress` directory.

### Porting to other database systems
Thanks to Prisma, **Rakkas RealWorld** is known to be able to run on MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL as well as on SQLite. Just follow these steps:

1. Change the `provider` in the file `prisma/schema.prisma` to `mysql` or `postgresql`.
2. Remove the `prisma/migrations` directory and its contents.
3. Change the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to a [connection URL](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls) for the target database.
4. Recreate the initial migration with `npx prisma migrate dev`.
5. Run the [tests](#testing) to make sure everything works fine.

See the older [SQLite branch](https://github.com/rakkasjs/rakkas-realworld/tree/sqlite) for an example of how to port to SQLite.

Porting to MongoDB or SQL Server should be similarly straightforward but it hasn't been tested.

### Connecting to a different backend
Open your browser's developer console and type the following:

```js
document.cookie="apiUrl=" + encodeURIComponent("https://conduit.productionready.io/api") // Or any other compatible backend URL
```

To use the builtin API again, just clear the cookies or run the following:

```js
document.cookie="apiUrl=;max-age=0"
```

Obviously, login sessions will not carry between different backends. Also please note that other backends aren't compatible with the form API, so the app won't run with JavaScript disabled if you replace the API URL.
